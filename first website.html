        When marimba rhythms start to play
        Dance with me, make me sway
        Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
        Hold me close, sway me more
        Like a flower bending in the breeze
        Bend with me, sway with ease
        When we dance, you have a way with me
        Stay with me, sway with me

        Other dancers may be on the floor
        Dear, but my eyes will see only you
        Only you have that magic technique
        When we sway, I go weak
        I can hear the sounds of violins
        Long before it begins
        Make me thrill as only you know how
        Sway me smooth, sway me now
